I skew most of my information for NextJS from:- 

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Explore Very Important Links realted to Next.js](https://github.com/Madhu5A3/VIL/tree/master/NextJS) - an interesting Repo of mine related to Next.js exploration.
